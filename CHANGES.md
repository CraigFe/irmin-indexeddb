## v0.5

Note: this release still uses Irmin 0.10.x, which is very out-of-date now.
However, this is a first step towards fixing the bit-rot.

- Update `js_of_ocaml` 2 -> 3.
- Update `base64` 2 -> 3.
- Upgrade opam 1 -> 2.
- Convert from oasis to dune.

## v0.4

Release never completed.
Was intended to support the now-obsolete Irmin 0.11.0 format.

## v0.3

- Updated for Irmin 0.10.0.
